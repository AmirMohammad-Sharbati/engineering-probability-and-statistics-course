# Engineering Probability and Statistics - SUT (Fall 2024)
This repository contains two R-based data analysis exercises completed as part of the **Engineering Probability and Statistics (EPS)** course at **Sharif University of Technology (SUT)** in Semester 3 (Fall 2024).  
All analyses were performed in **Jupyter Notebooks** using the **R kernel**, focusing on applying probability theory and statistical methods to datasets.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `practice_1/`
    - `EPS_Practical_Assignment_1.ipynb` # Completed notebook (R kernel)
    - `Autism-Adult-Data.arff` # Dataset
- `practice_2/`
    - `EPS_Practical_Assignment_2.ipynb` # Completed notebook (R kernel)
    - `simulated_fault_dataset.csv` # Dataset
- `LICENSE`
- `.gitattributes`
- `README.md`

The `.gitattributes` file instructs GitHub to recognize `.ipynb` notebooks as **R** code for more accurate language statistics.  
**Practice 2** is significantly more comprehensive: it contains 10 parts and is significantly longer than Practice 1.


## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Make sure R and Jupyter are installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirMohammad-Sharbati/engineering-probability-and-statistics-course.git
cd engineering-probability-statistics
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook.
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open `EPS_Practical_Assignment_X.ipynb` 
5. If prompted for a kernel, select R.
6. Run the cells to reproduce results.

#### Important Notes:
- **Working directory / file paths**: Notebooks reference datasets using relative paths (e.g., practice_2/simulated_fault_dataset.csv). Ensure you open Jupyter from the repository root so those relative paths work.
- **If you only want to view results**: In addition to GitHub you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) which renders Jupyter notebooks statically for easier viewing.
